# Simple Video Player

I'm unhappy with all the simple GIF-like video hosting solutions, so
this is my replacement where I have absolute control. It plays
anything out of my Amazon S3 bucket in a loop, given by the `v`
parameter. More parameters may be added in the future.

Examples:

* http://nullprogram.com/video/?v=julia-256
* http://nullprogram.com/video/?v=dragon-8
* http://nullprogram.com/video/?v=lissajous
